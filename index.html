						<h2>The Werewolves of Miller's Hollow</h2>
					</header>
					<p>The Werewolves of Millers Hollow (French: Les Loups-garous de Thiercelieux) is a popular card game among young players, created by the French authors Philippe des Pallières and Hervé Marly that can be played with 8 to 47 players. This project aims to model the standard game setting of 12 players with epistemic systems in the scope of course Multi-Agent Systems. The main focus is to experiment with high order knowledge and show how the depth of knowledge players use can play a role towards different outcomes of the game.</p>					<header>
                    <span class="byline">Game flow</span>
                    <p>In the beginning of each game, 12 players are divided into two secret teams – 4 werewolves and 8 villagers, including 4 special villagers and 4 ordinary ones. The 4 special villagers are the Seer, the Witch, the Hunter and the Savior. The game is based on the "kill all the ordinary villagers or all the special villagers " rule. The werewolves’ goal is to kill all one side of the villagers before being discovered. The villagers’ goal is to discover the werewolves and vote to lynch them. The game cycles between day and night. Before the night, the savior can choose one player to protect, from werewolves. During the night, everyone closes their eyes except for the seer. First the seer can choose a player and check its character card.  Then werewolves will wake up and silently decide which player they want to kill, and signal their choice to the moderator. Once they’ve made their choice, the witch then opens eyes and is told who the victim is. The witch also can choose to revive one with elixir or kill one with deadly potion, but each only once during one game. The moderator then asks everyone to open their eyes, and announces who was killed. If the player is the Hunter, he has the right to retaliate by killing another player of his choice instantly. Then everyone is free to say or do anything to guess who the werewolves are, and vote to lynch someone they suspect. That player reveals the identity, and again if the player is the Hunter, he has the right to retaliate by killing another player of his choice instantly. If there are any surviving werewolves, night begins again.</p>
                    <span class="byline">Characters</span>
                    <h3>Werewolves</h3>
                    <p>Each night they eat a villager. During the day they appear as a normal villager in order to disguise their identity.</p>
                    <h3>Ordinary Villagers</h3>
                    <p>He or she has no particular skills; he or she must be particularly intuitive.</p>
                    <h3>Seer</h3>
                    <p>Each night she can look at a card of a player of her choice to find out the real. She must help the villagers without being found out by the werewolves.</p>
                    <h3>Hunter</h3>
                    <p>If The Hunter gets killed, either by the werewolves at night or by the villagers during the day, has the power to retaliate by killing a player of his choice immediately.</p>
                    <h3>Witch</h3>
                    <p>She knows how to make up 2 extremely powerful potions: One elixir, which can revive the player that has been killed by the werewolves. One deadly potion which when used at night can kill a player. The witch must use each potion only once during the game. She can use her two potions on the same night and can use her potion to her advantage and heal herself.</p>
                    <h3>Savior</h3>
                    <p>During the night it can select one player and guarantee it will not be killed (not possible to save anyone consecutively twice).</p>
